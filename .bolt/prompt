🚀 Bolt.new Project Guideline for AI Development  

📌 General Principles:  
1. **Develop Step by Step** – Implement features in **small, testable pieces** to maintain stability. No large-scale changes at once.  
2. **Focus on Performance & SEO** – Use **Next.js best practices**, including:  
   - **Server-side rendering (SSR) & static site generation (SSG)** where appropriate.  
   - **Lazy loading & code splitting** for optimal page speed.  
   - **Optimized images & caching** to reduce load time.  
   - **SEO-friendly structure** (meta tags, structured data, sitemaps).  
3. **AI Must Ask Before Writing Code** – No new development should happen **without first explaining**:  
   - **Why the feature is needed.**  
   - **The best approach based on existing technologies.**  
   - **How it integrates into the current project.**  
4. **Test Everything Before Deployment** – Every new piece of code must go through:  
   - **Unit tests** for functionality.  
   - **Performance tests** to ensure site speed is not impacted.  
   - **SEO checks** to validate optimization efforts.  
   - **Manual review** before pushing to production.  

📢 Workflow for AI Development:  
- **Step 1:** AI proposes a feature/update with reasoning.  
- **Step 2:** We approve/reject or modify the approach.  
- **Step 3:** AI writes the smallest possible unit of code for the feature.  
- **Step 4:** Tests are run (automated + manual review).  
- **Step 5:** If tests pass, merge the change and continue.  

🔍 Additional Notes:  
- **No unnecessary libraries** – Use minimal dependencies for speed and security.  
- **Ensure compatibility** – The code must work with **Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel deployment.**  
- **Document everything** – AI should generate clear documentation for all new code.  

📌 **Final Rule:** **If in doubt, ask before coding.**
